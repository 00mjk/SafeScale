docopt-parser
=============

Modified [docopt.go](https;//github.com/docopt/docopt.go), an implementation of [docopt](http://docopt.org/) in the [Go](http://golang.org/) programming language

The goal is almost to keep only the parser part (without the help behaviour), and to modify this parser to return arguments also in case of failure.

By definition, heavily based on [docopt.go](https;//github.com/docopt/docopt.go)...
